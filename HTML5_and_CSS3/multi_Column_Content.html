        The top court upheld its 2017 verdict which permitted light motor vehicle license holders to drive transport vehicles weighing up to 7500 kilograms.

        A five-judge constitution bench, headed by CJI DY Chandrachud, said that road accidents are a matter of concern in the country but the petitions filed by insurance companies failed to provide any empirical proof that LMV license holders had resulted in more accidents.

        The Supreme Court was examining whether a person holding a driving licence in respect of a light motor vehicle (LMV) could, on the strength of that licence, be entitled to drive a transport vehicle of light motor vehicle class.

        The legal question had provoked various disputes over payment of claims by insurance companies in accident cases involving transport vehicles being driven by those holding LMV licenses.
